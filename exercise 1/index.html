                <h1>E-LEARNING</h1>
                <p>Understanding eLearning is simple. eLearning is learning utilizing electronic technologies to access
                    educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom. In most cases, it refers to a course,
                    program or degree delivered completely online.</p>
                <p>There are many terms used to describe learning that is delivered online, via the internet, ranging
                    from Distance Education, to computerized electronic learning, online learning, internet learning and
                    many others. We define eLearning as courses that are specifically delivered via the internet to
                    somewhere other than the classroom where the professor is teaching. It is not a course delivered via
                    a DVD or CD-ROM, video tape or over a television channel. It is interactive in that you can also
                    communicate with your teachers, professors or other students in your class. Sometimes it is
                    delivered live, where you can “electronically” raise your hand and interact in real time and
                    sometimes it is a lecture that has been prerecorded. There is always a teacher or professor
                    interacting /communicating with you and grading your participation, your assignments and your tests.
                    eLearning has been proven to be a successful method of training and education is becoming a way of
                    life for many citizens in North Carolina.</p>
